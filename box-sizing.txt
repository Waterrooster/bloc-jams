The box-sizing is the total size of the box including the size of content,border,padding and margin.By default the box-sizing is set to content-box. If the box-sizing is set to border-box it says that the size of the box is inclusive of the content. For instance if the total width is 100px with a padding 6px, border of 2px solid blue, the total width is 100+6+6+2+2 = 116px.
In case if the box-sizing is set to border-box the total width is 100px inclusive of padding 6px and border 2px.The total width will still be 100px.This doesnâ€™t include the margin size.
